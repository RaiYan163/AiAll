Today's Topic --- Game Theory.

-------------- Game_Theory_concept ---------------------
Two player will play games. My Target and goals, some criteria and condition will be said. In last there will be a terminal condition. We have to use the game.
Who will win, last e je nibe. at first two sticks are taken. 

-- There are some condition as well as some terminal condition. 
What are the states? 
--- 0 to 10 any one (example in slide: the stick one)

1. Perfect two-player Game.
   Max and Min.

example: Grundy's Game.
Example: Partial Tree for Tic-Tac-Toe

---The path, following which, our winning probability will be increased.
--- Games er tree small korar jonno algorithm use kora hoy, that is Alpha beta pruning.

--------- Alpha Beta Pruning ---------------
Pruning kore search tree choto kore fela.

Alpha beta value propagate kore niche namte pare, but upore dike uthte pare na, upore uthte pare node er value.

------------ Important for quizz -----------------
initially, alpha = minus inf, beta = + if
(javatpoint)

niche propagate korbo.

if alpha > beta --- then oi subtree ar use korbona, oita remove kore dite hobe.
What is the value in D?

Terminal value can go upwards.
